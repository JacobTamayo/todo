# Todo List
<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a simple todo list application that allows you to create a todo list, add tasks to that todo list, and then finish/edit those tasks to your liking. There is
also a calendar feature that allows you to view what specific tasks are due in that particular month and the application automatically saves whenever a change is made.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>


After this project, I have a much more solid grasp on webpack now than when I started. However, I feel that I could have done better.
Probably, one of the biggest missteps I have taken was the layout of my code. First, I never really spent time thinking about how to code a project to this scale,
as I am more used to smaller projects so I just jumped into it and started coding. This makes the general layout and organization of everything a bit confusing.

Next, I learned the hard lesson of how important code reusability is. There were multiple points that I needed to reuse pieces of code I had already done and I had to
redo certain chunks of code to allow for more reusability. I feel that something like this isn't something I can learn instantly but it is a good idea to keep in mind as I
design more projects.

Overall, I do feel more or less happy with how it turned out as I have never really done something as complicated as this, and I had to use multiple sources to be able to learn how to do everything unfamiliar to me. I feel that since my understanding of Javascript is still very basic that I am probably not utilizing many resources that 
would have made everything much easier but this is a good start to creating a solid foundation for my knowledge of the language as I continue to learn.
